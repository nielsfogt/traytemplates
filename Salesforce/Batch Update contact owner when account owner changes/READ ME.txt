How to use:
1. Upload the template to your Tray.io org
2. Create your authentications for Salesforce, ideally a Sandbox.
--- If you don't use a Sandbox, add a boolean check just inside the first loop to target a specific account ID.
--- This way you won't be updating contacts for a bunch of production Salesforce accounts
--- The other thing you can do is to add a terminate step right before the update contacts step.
3. Enable the workflow
4. Change an account owner on your test account, check the workflow logs
